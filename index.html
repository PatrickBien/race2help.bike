        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to race2help, where our passion for mountain biking meets a heartfelt commitment to community
            service. As a racing team specializing in MTB Enduro, bikepark adventures, challenging MTB marathons,
            thrilling dirt jumps, and competitive XCO races, we're more than just athletes -- we're agents of change.</p>

        <p>Our team is inspired by the ethos of 'Radeln und Helfen', and we channel our energy and determination into
            not only conquering trails but also making a meaningful difference in the lives of those in need. Every race
            we participate in, every trail we master, we do it with a purpose: to raise awareness and funds for vital
            causes, supporting disadvantaged and needy children.</p>

        <p>But race2help isn't just about racing and charity; it's about building a community. We encourage riders of
            all levels to join us, share in our passion, and contribute to a greater cause. Whether you're an
            experienced racer or a newcomer to the world of mountain biking, your participation helps to propel our
            mission forward.</p>
        <p>At race2help, we believe in the power of community, the thrill of the ride, and the joy of giving back. Join
            us, and let's race to make a difference together.</p>
